# Synchronous-FIFO
This project involves designing and implementing a synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer operating within a single clock domain. The FIFO efficiently handles data storage and retrieval, incorporating read/write control along with full and empty flags. Implemented in Verilog and simulated using Vivado.
